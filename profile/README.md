## Hi there 👋

We are currently migrating SageMath development from Trac to GitHub,
preserving the full history of Sage in the form of 35000 tickets.

If you got here because you received an invitation to join the SageMath organization:
We are sending out these invitations as part of our migration from
Trac to GitHub. The org invitation is to give all past contributors
the opportunity to have their contributions (such as comments on
tickets) linked to their GitHub accounts that we have on file.
Organization membership (with basic permissions) is a prerequisite for
that. It is fine to leave the organization again as soon as our import
has been completed (Feb 4, 2023).

If you do not wish your contributions to be linked to your account,
you can decline the invitation (or ignore the invitation); then your
contributions will be represented using a so-called mannequin account,
a placeholder.

More information on our migration: https://trac.sagemath.org/ticket/30363

**Here are some ideas to get you started:**

🙋‍♀️ A short introduction - what is your organization all about?
🌈 Contribution guidelines - how can the community get involved?
👩‍💻 Useful resources - where can the community find your docs? Is there anything else the community should know?
🍿 Fun facts - what does your team eat for breakfast?
🧙 Remember, you can do mighty things with the power of [Markdown](https://docs.github.com/github/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax)
