## Welcome! ðŸ‘‹

SageMath is a free, open-source mathematical software system based on the
Python programming language. It covers a wide range of mathematical areas
including algebra, calculus, number theory, geometry, graph theory,
combinatorics and much more. It is used to perform calculations, graphing,
simulations, and modeling in physics, cryptography, coding theory, optimization
and indeed in all of mathematical fields.

Sage, as we call SageMath for short, started with the aim of providing a free
alternative to proprietary mathematical software such as Magma, Maple,
Mathematica and Matlab. Thus it combines the power of many existing open-source
packages, and provides an integrated platform for open computing, education, and 
research. Now the SageMath project acts as an umbrella project
of open-source mathematical software.

The developer community of the SageMath project is constantly improving Sage
and related packages, and we invite you to help improve the source code, or
contribute in your own way. We heartily welcome all kinds of contributions,
technical or non-technical, from adding stars to our repositories, reporting
bugs or typos, commenting to issues, or creating Pulling Requests, to
donations. We provide a warm and supportive environment in which contributors
experience large-scale open-source software development for humanity. :two_hearts:

Announcements:

- We recently migrated SageMath development from Trac to GitHub,
  preserving [the full history of Sage in the form of 35000 tickets](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues).
  
  For more information on our GitHub migration, visit https://github.com/sagemath/trac-to-github/issues or 
  https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues/30363.

- If you got here because you received an invitation to join the SageMath
  organization: We sent out these invitations as part of our migration from
  Trac to GitHub. The org invitation was sent to give all past contributors the
  opportunity to have their contributions (such as comments on tickets) linked
  to their GitHub accounts that we have on file.  Organization membership (with
  basic permissions) was a prerequisite for that.

  Now that the migration is complete, you can check that your contributions are
  well preserved in [the issues converted from Trac, numbered up to 34959](https://github.com/sagemath/sage/issues).
  If you are represented by a so-called mannequin account, a placeholder, then stay tuned to
  [the mannequin account reclaim procedure](https://github.com/sagemath/trac-to-github/issues/173).
